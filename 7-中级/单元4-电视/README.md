**The City's Dark Future**

'City Dark,' Cable 12's new police drama, is **set** in Chicago in the year 2050. In the first **episode**, Detective Ella Washington is walking down the stairs to her apartment when she finds a man who has been **murdered**. This isn't unusual, as the city has become more **violent** and dangerous. But two hours later, a woman is found dead in the apartment building of Ella's colleague, Dallas. Dallas tells Ella that the man and the woman had been in a 12-year relationship and had just decided to **separate**.

The plot was certainly fascinating. And here's an example of the **dialogue**, which was often weird but realistic:

Ella: They were a couple? You mean, like, in a relationship?

Dallas: Married, in love, engaged or just romantic friends – I don't know. But they were definitely in a relationship.
