### City Builds Electric Car Charging Stations
People can now charge their electric cars in the city parking lot.

"We've built two charging stations for electric cars," said city engineer Randolph Schmidt. "If people use more clean electricity for cars and less dirty gasoline, we can decrease air pollution."

Alma Torres commutes 80 kilometers a day to her bank job in her electric car. "The city charging stations are wonderful. They show that the city cares about saving the environment around us," she said.

The city is also serious about improving water and air quality, Schmidt said. Last year, the city stopped using coal. Now, natural gas powers all city buildings.
