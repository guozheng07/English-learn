### penalty 点球  
Penalty 在英文中本意为惩罚，因为在足球中最严厉的惩罚就是点球，所以点球就称为 penalty。

If the score remains tied after both of the 15-minute extra time sessions, the two teams then go to **penalty** kicks.  
如果在两个15分钟的加时赛之后比分仍然持平，两队将进行点球大战（penalty shootout）决胜。

The best-of-five shootout **features** one-on-one situations between the kicker and the **opposing goalkeeper**. Teams must use different kickers for each attempt, alternating
attempts with the opposing team. Kickers are taken from the penalty mark, witch is 12 yards from the goal.    
五轮点球大战的特点是踢点球球员和对方门将之间展开一对一较量。球队必须每次安排不同球员踢点球，双方球队交替进行。射门位置位于距离球门12码的罚球点。

Once the shootout lead is **insurmountable**, the game is over. If still tied through five rounds of penalty kicks, the shootout goes to sudden death. The first team to have an
an advantage after a completed round **is declared** the winner of the game.  
一旦一方进球处于绝对领先，对方无法反超，则比赛宣布结束。如果五轮点球结束，双方仍未分出胜负，则采用“突然死亡法”加罚：即双方继续罚点球，直至某一轮结束后，一方取得优势（一方罚球进而另一方未罚进），便赢得本场比赛胜利。
