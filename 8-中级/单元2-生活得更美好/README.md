## 阅读 法国悖论
**The French Paradox**

Many French people love eating cheese. French cooking often involves meat, rich sauces（丰富的酱汁） and buttery desserts（黄油甜点）. Usually when people eat a lot of **fatty** foods（高脂肪食物）, there is **a danger of** heart and other health problems. This is true in a country like the United States. The **paradox**（悖论） – or thing that doesn't make sense – is that the French suffer far less from these kinds of problems, compared with some other countries. This is the French paradox. No one is sure, but some **believe** it's due to **red wine**. Many doctors think a glass or two of red wine each day is **good for** the heart.

## 阅读 压力及其对我们生活的影响
Everyone has stress in their lives. Stress is the way our body reacts to what is happening in and around us. Eustress, or good stress, can help people work to their potential and feel good about themselves. Think about a time when your boss told you what a good job you were doing, or you were excited playing a game. That is eustress. Sometimes it is called positive stress.

On the other hand, distress, or bad stress, is not a good thing. When stress becomes too much for a person to deal with, it can cause problems. The problems can be physical or mental. Stress can result in problems like insomnia, headaches, depression and anxiety. Obviously, we want as much eustress, and as little distress, in our lives as possible.
