being sloppy 粗心  
being argumentative	好辩  
being offensive	无礼  
not being flexible 处事不灵活

### 选词填空
JOSH: My **boss** wanted to speak with me today. And it wasn't very nice.  
PAM: What **for** ?  
JOSH: For not meeting my **deadline**.  
PAM: Oh, no. I'm sorry.  
JOSH: Yeah, and also for **being** argumentative.  
PAM: Really? Well, you are a bit **argumentative** – sometimes.  
JOSH: Me? Argumentative? No way! I am not.  
PAM: You see?  
JOSH: What?  
PAM: Did your boss mention anything else?
JOSH: Uh, yeah. He said I need to work on being more **flexible**.
PAM: Yeah … Good luck with that.
### 录音

Being argumentative at work is not a good thing. 工作中爱争论不是好事。

## 语法 'who'引导的关系从句
Frank is someone who enjoys a cup of coffee.  
Oscar is someone who enjoys a practical joke. Oscar是一个喜欢开玩笑的人。

用关系从句连接两个句子。关系从句使您的写作和讲话更流利，并帮助您避免重复。关系代词 **who** 用来指人。
 
We have a lot of engineers. The engineers work late.                  

We have a lot of engineers who work late.

在例子中，主句**We have a lot of engineers**是一个完整的句子。关系从句**who work late**不是一个完整的句子，故不能独立成句。
### 选词填空
